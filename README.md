# PennPals

In this project, I developed PennPals, a feature-rich Java-based internet chat server. The project aimed to facilitate real-time communication between users, supporting multiple simultaneous client connections and dynamic user management.

**Features**


Multiple Connections: Handles numerous client connections concurrently, allowing multiple users to join and interact in real-time.

User Management: Supports dynamic nickname changes, user invitations, and removals, ensuring a flexible user experience.

Channels: Implements both public and private channels, enabling users to create and join channels based on their preferences.

Command Protocol: Utilizes a comprehensive command protocol for seamless server-client interaction, supporting commands like JOIN, LEAVE, NICK, INVITE, and more.


**Implementation Details**


Data Structures: Leveraged TreeSet and TreeMap for efficient management of user sessions and channel memberships, optimizing performance and scalability.

Concurrency: Employed multithreading to manage concurrent connections and ensure smooth operation without bottlenecks.

Error Handling: Implemented robust error handling to manage unexpected user inputs and maintain server stability.


**Impact**


This project enhanced my skills in Java programming, data structure implementation, and concurrent user management. It provided hands-on experience in building scalable network applications and improved my understanding of real-time communication protocols.


**Conclusion**


PennPals is a testament to the power of Java in developing scalable and efficient server-side applications. It demonstrates the importance of proper data structure choice and concurrency management in building applications that handle real-time data and multiple users efficiently.
